# SessionShift

A Chrome extension that gives each tab its own isolated session, letting you stay logged into multiple accounts on the same site simultaneously. A free, open-source alternative to SessionBox.

**[Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sessionshift/incpbanbmacagomhkmbjmncnhimngcmp)**  
**Current Version:** 0.0.8

2. Click **Add to Chrome**
3. Authorize permissions
4. Done — the popup appears in your toolbar

### Install from Source (Development)
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/anhkiet75/session-shift.git`
2. Install deps: `npm install`

## Features

- **Profile-based isolation** — Each profile is a global cookie container (like a Chrome profile); assign a tab to a profile and its cookies apply on every site that tab visits
- **Named profiles** — Create, rename, recolor, and switch between profiles with custom names
- **One global profile list** — A single searchable list; a profile created on one site is selectable on every site
- **URL routing rules** — Create Rules in a separate popup tab to bind matching HTTP(S) URLs to a Profile automatically; scheme and hostname are required, while port and full-URL regex are optional
- **Manual override per tab** — A manually selected Profile wins over URL Rules until you choose **Restore auto match**, so two tabs on the same URL can still use different Profiles
- **Auto-inherit for linked tabs** — Tabs opened via links (`target="_blank"`, Ctrl+Click, middle-click) automatically inherit the opener tab's profile (toggle in Options, default on)
- **Open in new tab** — Right-click a profile in the popup to open the current page in that profile's session
- **Context menu integration** — Right-click any link → "Open in Session" to open it in a specific profile
- **Badge indicator** — Toolbar badge shows the active profile at a glance, in the profile's color with a contrast-picked label
- **Color-coded toolbar icon** — The extension icon itself is tinted with the active profile's color, so two tabs on different profiles are distinguishable without reading the badge
- **Group tabs by profile** — Optional native Chrome tab groups, one per profile (Options → off by default, requests the `tabGroups` permission only when enabled; reorders tabs and quantizes color to Chrome's 9 preset group colors)
- **Duplicate profile** — Clone a profile's cookies into a new profile with one click
- **Persistent across restarts** — Session assignments survive service worker restarts
- **55 languages** — Full UI localization with honest quality tiers, RTL support (Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew), and English fallback for destructive/security messages on unreviewed locales
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Ctrl+Shift+S` to open popup; `Ctrl+Shift+Right/Left` to cycle profiles (customizable in `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`)
- **Theme switcher** — Dark / Light / System preference in Options, plus a quick toggle in the popup hero
- **Works on any site** — No per-site configuration; covers all URLs
- **No external services** — Fully offline; no analytics, no CDN, no runtime dependencies
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** — Keyboard navigation, focus-visible rings, ARIA labels on all interactive elements, ≥4.5:1 contrast ratio

## How It Works

SessionShift isolates cookies at three layers:

1. **Network Layer (DNR)** — Rewrite Cookie headers per-tab via Declarative Net Request
2. **Storage Layer** — Maintain per-profile cookie stores in `chrome.storage.local`
3. **DOM Layer** — Override `document.cookie`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage` via content scripts

Each tab is assigned a profile, either manually or by a URL Rule. Rules only decide the `tab → profileId` binding; the existing isolation layers then inject and expose only that Profile's cookies and storage.

```
Tab 1 (Profile A) ──DNR Rule──→ Cookie: profile_a_cookie_1=value
Tab 2 (Profile B) ──DNR Rule──→ Cookie: profile_b_cookie_1=value
         ↓
    Both tabs simultaneously logged in to the same site
```

**Technical deep-dive:** See [`docs/system-architecture.md`](docs/system-architecture.md)

---

## Usage

### Create a Profile
1. Open the SessionShift popup (click toolbar icon or `Ctrl+Shift+S`)
2. Type a name (e.g., "Work", "Personal")
3. Click **Create**
4. The current tab now uses that profile; cookies are isolated

### Switch Profiles
1. Open popup
2. Click any profile in the list (or cycle with `Ctrl+Shift+Right/Left`)
3. Page reloads with that profile's cookies

### Route URLs to a Profile Automatically
1. Open the popup and select the **Rules** tab
2. Create a Rule and select its target Profile
3. Enter the required scheme and hostname; optionally enter a port, URL regex, or custom priority
4. Save the Rule — matching top-level navigations now bind that tab to the selected Profile

A manual Profile selection is a per-tab override. Use **Restore auto match** in the popup to let Rules control that tab again.

### Open Current Page in Another Profile
1. Right-click a profile card in the popup
2. Choose **Open in new tab** — the page opens in a new tab bound to that profile

### Open Link in a Profile
1. Right-click any link on a web page
2. Hover over **Open in Session**
3. Select a profile from the submenu
4. Link opens in a new tab with that profile active

### Delete a Profile
1. Open popup
2. Hover over a profile, click **Delete**
3. All cookies for that profile are permanently removed
4. Tabs in that profile are reset to default
5. Rules that referenced it are retained and shown as **Deleted profile**, but can never match until reassigned to an existing Profile

### Settings (Options Page)
- **Theme** — Dark / Light / System
- **Language** — Pick any of the 55 supported languages (applies to popup, Options, and context menus)
- **Auto-open linked tabs in the same profile** — Toggle link-opened-tab profile inheritance (default on)
- **Group tabs by profile in the tab strip** — Toggle native Chrome tab groups; requests the `tabGroups` permission on enable (default off)

### Reset to Default
Click **Reset to default** to return the current tab to the browser's global cookie jar

## Security

- **Cookies never exposed in DOM** — Stored only in `chrome.storage.local` and DNR rules
- **Nonce-authenticated messages** — Prevents rogue page scripts from hijacking postMessage
- **Prefix-scoped storage** — localStorage/sessionStorage isolated per profile
- **No eval, no unsafe DOM manipulation** — Follows security best practices
- **No external services** — Fully offline; no analytics, no CDN

See [System Architecture § Threat Model](docs/system-architecture.md#threat-model--mitigations) for details.

## Testing

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

```bash
npm run test:unit     # run all Vitest unit tests (299 tests)
```

Coverage areas: Rule storage/resolution/binding, session lifecycle, DNR rule building, Set-Cookie parsing, cookie write locking, page-proxy isolation and storage, profile migration, linked-tab inheritance, public-suffix matching, storage GC, manifest permissions, and localization (catalog integrity, runtime adapter, critical-key fallback).

### Locale Validation

```bash
npm run validate:locales                  # 55 catalogs: key/placeholder parity, charset checks
npm run validate:localization-artifacts   # build/package localization artifacts
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

Chrome extensions require `headless: false`, so E2E runs go through the Docker-based runner (which provides a display on any host):

```bash
npm run build             # compile TypeScript first (required)
npm run test:e2e:docker   # run Playwright suite in Docker (39 tests)
```

E2E suites in `tests/e2e/`:
- `session-isolation.test.ts` — DNR cookie isolation between profiles
- `session-crud.test.ts` — create, switch, delete, duplicate via popup UI
- `global-session-list.test.ts` — cross-origin global profile list and search filter
- `linked-tab-profile-inheritance.test.ts` — profile inheritance for link-opened tabs
- `profile-open-in-new-tab.test.ts` — right-click "Open in new tab" cookie isolation
- `theme-switcher.test.ts` — dark/light/system theme persistence
- `localization-rtl.test.ts` — RTL rendering, locale switching, manifest/context-menu i18n
- `native-locale-smoke.test.ts` — native `chrome.i18n` locale smoke tests

## Known Limitations

- **Private browsing:** Sessions don't persist (chrome.storage.session limitation)
- **No auto-login:** You must manually log in once per profile
- **Top-level navigation only:** URL Rules do not react to iframe/subresource URLs or SPA `pushState` changes in the current version
- **One automatic result per URL:** Identical URLs resolve to the same Rule winner; use a manual per-tab override when identical URLs need different Profiles
- **Deleted Profile references stay visible:** An orphaned Rule is preserved for repair but is excluded from matching and cannot reactivate its deleted Profile ID
- **Linked-tab first request:** For link-opened tabs, the very first network request may not be hard-guaranteed cookie-clean due to browser timing; isolation is deterministic from the second request onward
- **Tab grouping is opt-in and lossy:** Native Chrome tab groups (Options) quantize each profile's color to one of Chrome's 9 preset group colors, so two similarly-colored profiles can end up with the same group color. Assigning a tab to a profile always moves it into that profile's group — if the tab was the last one in a group you made by hand, Chrome removes that group; this is inherent to `chrome.tabs.group()`, not something SessionShift can opt out of
